# BFS-Breadth-first-search-BFS-
By using Bellman-Ford &amp; Dijkstra algorithms doing BFS
How to run the code 
Download the code file 
import all the libraries properly 
runn the code 
u can find the graphs it will change depending on the user input 
conclusion :Dijkstra performs better compared to Bellman-Ford whose runtimeincreases significantly due to its high time complexity.
